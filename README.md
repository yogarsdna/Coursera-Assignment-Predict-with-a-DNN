# Coursera Assignment - Predict with a DNN

This is one of the Coursera assignments provided in the Sequences, Time Series, and Prediction course in the week 2 section where it discusses Deep Neural Networks for Time Series. This assignment is about creating our own synthetic dataset, then figuring out the parameters that get this series, and lastly, we will create a DNN to predict values for that series.
